        <div class="column"><p>"Lorraine was the primary caregiver for my mother Marilyn for three years prior to the date of this letter.</p>
        <p>"My mother had advanced Parkinson’s Disease, and was 100% disabled. Being unable to care for herself, she required 24-hour caregiving for the duration of Lorraine’s employment with us. Her care was very intense and involved multiple layers of medical intervention and assistance with activities of daily living. This included but was not limited to assistance ambulating, bathing, dressing, feeding, incontinence, exercise, skin care, transferring, medication monitoring, and oversight of home medical appointments in the absence of myself or other family members. There were also household duties required of Lorraine to ensure my mother’s immediate environment was clean and safe for her, as well as for the other caregivers in the household.</p>
        <p>"Lorraine worked in excess of 72 hours per week, primarily attending to the personal care of my mother. In addition, she oversaw the training and work performance of three other caregivers who were in her employ and part of our caregiving team.</p>
        <p>"Lorraine’s personal attention to my mother went beyond the usual job description of caregiver. As a matter of routine, she consistently strove to create a loving and warm atmosphere for my mother which was so much the more needed, beyond my mother’s physical needs. She was acutely aware of my mother’s moods and social needs and spent countless hours attending to the small details of personal grooming and human touch, which in itself so greatly enhanced my mother’s quality of life, especially in her last weeks of life.</p>
        <p>"My mother suffered extreme debility for many years with her advanced disease, but she was happy and secure in Lorraine’s care and loving presence. A daughter could not expect to find this level of devotion nor could a family place more trust in facilities, institutions or agencies. We know because we tried them all. We found our peace and confidence in Lorraine’s presence in our home.</p>
        <p>"We are certain that the next patient Lorraine cares for can expect the same high level of care and concern that we were blessed to enjoy."</p>

        <p>"Lorraine is a very special person who understands my mother’s situation and is very sweet and kind, knowledgeable and outgoing. She takes extreme care of my mother. She informs me of meds, supplies, and when the doctor and nurse visit. When family visit my mother they see how well she looks.</p> 
        <p>"I’m very lucky to have her (Lorraine). It feels good to know my mother is in good hands."</p>

        <p>"Dear Lorraine,</p>
        <p>"Thank you for Carmen and Jenny. They are a true blessing.</p>
        <p>"Good luck with everything and take care.</p>
        <p>"Sincerely,"</p>

            <p>"I am very happy to provide Lorraine with this letter of recommendation.</p>
            <p>"Lorraine took excellent care of my mother from June of 2003 until September 16, 2005. She provided care 24 hours a day, seven days per week, following my mother’s hip surgery.</p>
            <p>"We found Lorraine to be very trustworthy, honest and responsible. She is also an extremely warm, kind, gentle, loving and caring individual. She did an excellent job helping my mother with everything including assisting her with most activities of daily living (bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring), assisting with exercises, laundry, housekeeping and administering medications.</p>
            <p>"My family and I were quite happy and satisfied with her services and her personal care.</p>
            <p>"We enjoyed her company a great deal and we felt as if she were part of the family.</p>
            <p>"Very truly yours,"</p>

        <p>"Lorraine,</p> 
        <p>"Thank you for your services and wonderful care by you and your staff to my mother. Hope you and Maricel come visit us and stay in touch.</p>
        <p>"Happy new year to you and your family!</p>
        <p>"Love and best wishes,"</p>

        <p>"My mother was blessed to have The Good Shepherd provide home care support. The firm, headed by Lorraine Lucas, delivered the highest quality services. Caregivers Maricel, Angel and Miriam were compassionate, caring individuals, who not only provided topnotch services but also were wonderful and caring friends.</p> 
        <p>"The owner, Lorraine, also provided caregiving to my mom Phyllis and she too was exceptional.</p>
        <p>"We are pleased my mom is now close to us (geographically) at a wonderful assisted care center, but she and her family miss the wonderful caregivers from [The] Good Shepherd. They will always be good friends to her and her family."</p>

        <p>"I felt very fortunate to have had [The] Good Shepherd responsible for the well-being of my mother. She was kept clean, had a happy attitude. We (the family) were kept aware of Mom’s needs so that we were able to get medical attention if needed.</p>
        <p>"Lorraine checked with us frequently to ensure that all was going well.</p>
        <p>"Thank you,"</p>
