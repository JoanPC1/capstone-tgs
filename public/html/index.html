        <p>"My mother suffered extreme debility for many years with her advanced disease, but she was happy and secure in Lorraine’s care and loving presence. A daughter could not expect to find this level of devotion nor could a family place more trust in facilities, institutions or agencies. We know because we tried them all. We found our peace and confidence in Lorraine’s presence in our home.</p>
        <p>"We are certain that the next patient Lorraine cares for can expect the same high level of care and concern that we were blessed to enjoy."</p>

        <p>"We found Lorraine to be very trustworthy, honest and responsible. She is also an extremely warm, kind, gentle, loving and caring individual. She did an excellent job helping my mother with everything including assisting her with most activities of daily living (bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring), assisting with exercises, laundry, housekeeping and administering medications.</p>
        <p>"My family and I were quite happy and satisfied with her services and her personal care.</p>
        <p>"We enjoyed her company a great deal and we felt as if she were part of the family.</p>
