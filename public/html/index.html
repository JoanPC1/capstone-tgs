        <br>
        <p>"Lorraine [owner and manager of The Good Shepherd Home Care, LLC] was the primary caregiver for my mother Marilyn for three years prior to the date of this letter.</p>
        <p>"My mother had advanced Parkinson’s Disease, and was 100% disabled. Being unable to care for herself, she required 24-hour caregiving for the duration of Lorraine’s employment with us. Her care was very intense and involved multiple layers of medical intervention and assistance with activities of daily living. This included but was not limited to assistance ambulating, bathing, dressing, feeding, incontinence, exercise, skin care, transferring, medication monitoring, and oversight of home medical appointments in the absence of myself or other family members. There were also household duties required of Lorraine to ensure my mother’s immediate environment was clean and safe for her, as well as for the other caregivers in the household.</p>
        <p>"Lorraine worked in excess of 72 hours per week, primarily attending to the personal care of my mother. In addition, she oversaw the training and work performance of three other caregivers who were in her employ and part of our caregiving team.</p>
        <p>"Lorraine’s personal attention to my mother went beyond the usual job description of caregiver. As a matter of routine, she consistently strove to create a loving and warm atmosphere for my mother which was so much the more needed, beyond my mother’s physical needs. She was acutely aware of my mother’s moods and social needs and spent countless hours attending to the small details of personal grooming and human touch, which in itself so greatly enhanced my mother’s quality of life, especially in her last weeks of life.</p>
        <p>"My mother suffered extreme debility for many years with her advanced disease, but she was happy and secure in Lorraine’s care and loving presence. A daughter could not expect to find this level of devotion nor could a family place more trust in facilities, institutions or agencies. We know because we tried them all. We found our peace and confidence in Lorraine’s presence in our home.</p>
        <p>"We are certain that the next patient Lorraine cares for can expect the same high level of care and concern that we were blessed to enjoy."</p>
