            <h1>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)</h1>
            <br>      
            <h4>What home care services do you offer?</h4>
            <p>We offer personal care, companion/sitter, and homemaking services. You can find out more about our services <a href="services" id="faq">here.</a></p>
            <br>
            <h4>Why should I choose an experienced home care agency like The Good Shepherd, instead of directly hiring a caregiver?</h4>
            <p><ul>
                <li>There is a guarantee that caregivers or home care service workers are properly trained to meet the qualifying standards of government agencies concerned such as the Department of Health.</li>
                <li>The agency performs criminal background checks, health checks and reference checks to ensure that clients are safe against abuses, health hazards or anything that may compromise their safety.</li>
                <li>The agency directly and periodically supervises the performance of the caregiver assigned to each client to ensure that efficient care is being performed at all times. Regular training is given to our caregivers.</li>
                <li>The client is guaranteed that there will be no gap in service because the agency has the manpower or pool of qualified candidates to fill in, in case the assigned caregiver is not able to work because of life’s emergencies.</li>
            </ul></p>
            <br>
            <h4>What makes The Good Shepherd different from other home care agencies?</h4>
            <p>The Good Shepherd Home Care, LLC, is an Illinois-based agency established in 2011 by owner and manager Lorraine Lucas, who has had long-term experience with caregiving in Illinois. Lorraine is a seasoned caregiver whose experienced management ensures highly qualified and well-trained caregivers that are able to manage difficult situations and complex cases. She and co-owner Irene Gomez, who has a background in medicine and nursing, meticulously choose suitable caregivers and tailor each placement with the client’s optimal well-being and satisfaction in mind.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Family members have been looking after my elderly parent. Do we really need a caregiver?</h4>
            <p>We love our parents and would do anything we could for them. However, there are times when family carers just don’t have enough time, experience or knowledge, especially when a beloved parent, spouse, sibling or child has complex care needs. Even if they have the knowledge and the time, looking after a loved one who has significant and/or long-term care needs can still feel overwhelming and stressful.</p>
            <p>Professional caregivers have the required training in providing assistance to frail and elderly individuals in the safest way possible. Our caregivers are trained to work with families and usually have many years of experience as professional caregivers, so they have the know-how in dealing with complex care needs. </p>
            <br>
            <h4>What is an in-home assessment? Do I need to pay for this?</h4>
            <p>Non-medical assessments are FREE assessments that we conduct in the client’s home. This home visit allows us to assess the client’s functioning capabilities, identify their needs, and determine what services are needed. You do not pay for an assessment and are under no obligation to avail of our services based on our assessment.</p>
            <p>If service is requested, it can be arranged for at the time of inquiry or following an in-home assessment. You can schedule an assessment by giving us a call or <a href="contact" id="faq">sending us a message.</a></p>
            <br>
            <h4>How are service costs determined?</h4>
            <p>We charge a variable rate based on the type of service needed, when it is provided, and where it is delivered. Costs are worked out and discussed with clients prior to commencement of service. Services are available from a few hours a day to 24 hours a day.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>What payment options do you offer?</h4>
            <p>We generally accept private pay. We can also bill insurance companies when applicable.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>What if I need services outside the locations where you normally provide them?</h4>
            <p>While we primarily serve Cook, DuPage, Will, and Lake Counties, we will strive to accommodate your need if you require service outside these locations. Feel free to send us a message through this website's contact section or give us a call to discuss your requirements.</p>
