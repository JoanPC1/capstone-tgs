            <h1>ABOUT THE GOOD SHEPHERD HOME CARE</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>Management</h2>
            <p>We are proud to have been serving our clients in Illinois since we opened our doors in 2011. Prior to this, owner and manager Lorraine Lucas has had long-term caregiving experience in Illinois. Being from a tradition of close family ties in which elders are cherished and revered members of the family, Lorraine’s personal dedication to caring for clients as she would care for her own parents and family has enabled her and co-owner Irene Gomez, who has a background in medicine and nursing, to build a company that consistently delivers high quality home care services.</p>
            <p>We have built a reputation among our clients as a trusted provider of home care services. We offer our services in Cook, DuPage, Will, and Lake Counties. When a need arises, we strive to accommodate anyone who requires service outside these locations.</p>
            <p>The Good Shepherd Home Care, LLC is licensed, bonded and insured.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Our mission</h2>
            <p>We are committed to helping our clients lead dignified, independent lifestyles in the comfort and safety of their own homes. This involves carefully assessing and fully understanding your individual needs, and selectively placing trained personnel to meet those needs.</p>
            <p>Through periodic assessments and open communication with our clients and their families, as well as continuing training and skills updates for our workers, we endeavor to consistently meet high standards of care for our clients.</p>
